#BBEdit Indent

A Sublime Text 3 package that enables text indentation by a single character at a time.

## Installation

Installation is performed via [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/).

## Usage

Normal indentation is performed by `cmd-[` and `cmd-]`, to indent by a single character shift is added: `cmd-shift-[` or `cmd-shift-]`. This overrides the the `prev_view` and `next_view` commands (`cmd-alt-left` and `cmd-alt-right` continue to be used for the `prev_view` and `next_view` commands).

This matches the behaviour of [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) and [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/).

## Tests

Tests can be run using the [UnitTesting](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/UnitTesting) package.

Choose `UnitTesting` from the command pallette then enter `Bbedit-Indent` (note the case is different) as the package name.
