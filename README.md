BBEdit Indent
============
A simple plugin that enables indentation by a single character at a time when `cmd-shift-[` or `cmd-shift-]` is pressed. This overrides the the `prev_view` and `next_view` commands (`cmd-alt-left` and `cmd-alt-right` continue to be used for the `prev_view` and `next_view` commands).

This matches the behaviour of [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) and [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/).
